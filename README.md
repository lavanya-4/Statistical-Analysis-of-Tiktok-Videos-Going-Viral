# Statistical-Analysis-of-Tiktok-Videos-Going-Viral

TikTok has become one of the most popular and in-demand social media applications, used by millions of people. It is widely leveraged for advertising brands and products, including technology advertisements, as it reaches a large and diverse audience. I am interested in understanding why TikTok is so influential and what type of videos have the highest impact on the audience and their marketing interests. Where as I am curious to know about


I would like to explore below questions based on the given data:

1.   Generation of content which leads to higest likes and shares?
2.   Finding the correlation between the reach and the influencers follower count?
       * Although follower counts is not directly within the dataset, we can work with Views as a substitute measure for reach and find correlations to Likes, Shares, and Comments this will help us for achieving the infulencer followers.
3. Do specific content types (e.g., tutorials, product reviews, etc.) perform better with certain age groups, genders, or user interests (e.g., scholarship interest)?

From the prespective of stakeholder the above analysis might help in organizatinal growth and also helps in marketing the the tiktok with the help of influencers and advertising the product on best time to post.


<b>Additonal variables:</b>


*   User demographic
*   Hashtag
*   Posting time
*   Influencer count
*   Type of video whether it is for promotional or experimental

<h3> <b>Type of Study </b></h3>

The type of study is observational as it represents the existing tiktok video analysis without changing the existing data. The aim is to identify the correlation between the features for the increment of the likes or views based on reels we have posted.

**Data Source :**

The data is collected from the kaggle. The dataset consists of hashtag, shares, likes comments etc [1].

**Data collection:**

The data is collected from the third party API's of social media analytics that are publicly avaliable on websites. Additionally, from the public API's of the tiktok engagement metrics. The time period hasn't mentioned in the kaggle as it is public but the data in it will be the past two years or one.It is the observational study as i am checking on the trends and not manipulating any data for analysis.

**Units of observation:**
The unit of observation in this data is a single TikTok video post. Each row is the metadata for a TikTok video, likes, content type, user demographic, views etc. Essentially, each row is comparable to the performance and characteristics of a single video or post, so the unit of observation is the individual TikTok post.

**Variables Used:**

The variables that I am planning to study for the analysis is
Likes, Comments, Shares, Views, Content, Type, ContentType, UserDemographic, AgeGroup, Gender, InterestInScholarships.
Based on these variables for analysis of the tiktok vidoes and posts. I will be working on these variables for

*   content and the relation type(likes, views, shares)
*   showing how gender demographic is used for performance on post.
